This lot occupies a large space in the center of campus. Closing it to vehicle parking would have two big benefits. First, the space could be turned into a pleasant, grassy area. And second, since this would reduce the traffic on campus, students will be more likely to ride their bikes or walk to classes.\nQuestion: The woman expresses her opinion about the student' s letter in the campus paper. Briefly summarize the proposal in the letter. Then state the woman's opinion about the proposal, and explain the reasons she gives for holding that opinion.` },
    3: { title: 'Negative Phototaxis', passage: `While many organisms need light to survive, certain animals that live in dark environments need to avoid light because it threatens their survival. When exposed to light from the Sun or another source, these animals move away from the light, seeking darkness. This movement pattern is called negative phototaxis. Negative phototaxis allows animals to avoid the dangerous effects of being exposed to light. In order to be able to move away from light, these animals often have speci√†l physical features that allow them to sense the presence of light, since they live in the dark and may not have fully developed vision.\nQuestion: Explain how the example ofthe earthworm illustrates negative phototaxis.` },
